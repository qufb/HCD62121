# Ghidra Processor Module for Hitachi HCD62121

**Status**: Disassembly mostly done, but pcode needs to be fixed and adjusted to be more decompiler-friendly.

Used in Casio CFX-9850, Picky Talk (JD-370), Magic Diary (JD-5000)... also likely includes devices using HD62119A03 (unconfirmed until one is dumped).

The "C" in HCD is used for [chip-on-board CPUs](https://www.hitachi.co.jp/New/cnews/9812/1217a.html).
